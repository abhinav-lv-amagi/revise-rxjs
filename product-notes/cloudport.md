# Cloudport

[What is Cloudport?](https://helpdocs.amagi.tv/docs/what-is-cloudport)

> A cloud based platform that offers distribution of channels over IP, fiber and satellite to IP-enabled video platforms and devices. (TV, smartphones, laptops, etc. - no need of a set top box and a traditional broadcasting network.)

## Features

- Content ingest
- Scheduling
- Playlist creation
- Graphics insertion
- Playout
- Monitoring
- Delivery of streams to multiple destinations (Live / VOD)

So it's basically a unified platform that provides all the features of a traditional broadcasting solution, over cloud.

## Food for thought

- Broadcast vs streaming (what is traditional broadcasting?)
